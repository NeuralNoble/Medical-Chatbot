# MediBot 

A Medical Question-Answering Chatbot powered by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology. This system combines Flask for the web interface, Pinecone for vector storage, HuggingFace for embeddings, and OpenAI's language model for generating responses. Users can ask medical-related questions, and the system retrieves relevant information from its knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware answers. The RAG architecture ensures responses are grounded in reliable medical information rather than just generated text.

## Here is the architecture of the project
